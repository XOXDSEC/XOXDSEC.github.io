# XOXDSEC â€” My Cybersecurity Blog

This repository contains the content of my personal cybersecurity blog:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://xoxdsec.github.io](https://xoxdsec.github.io)

I started this blog to document my learning journey in cybersecurity â€” from the early baby steps to the deeper, more technical parts of the field. Itâ€™s where I write about the topics Iâ€™m studying, reflect on what Iâ€™m learning, and share notes that might help others walking a similar path.

Youâ€™ll find posts on malware analysis, threat hunting, DFIR, AppSec, and other areas that I explore through hands-on labs, personal research, and challenges I take on â€” like **#100DaysOfMalware**.

This space helps me think more clearly, write more intentionally, and connect with people who care about security the way I do. If you're into that too, I hope you'll follow along.

Thanks for visiting.
