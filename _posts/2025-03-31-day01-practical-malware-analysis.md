Hey friends,

Today I’m kicking off something that’s been on my mind for a long time: the **#100DaysOfMalware** challenge. I’ve talked about getting deeper into malware analysis for a while, but I’ve always hesitated. It’s one of those corners of cybersecurity that looks amazing from a distance — but up close, it’s dense, technical, and frankly a little intimidating.

But I’ve reached a point where *not doing it* feels worse than diving in unprepared. So I’m starting. One chapter at a time. One post at a time. One day at a time.

## Day 1 — Opening the Book

I’m using *Practical Malware Analysis* as my starting point. It’s a classic in the field, and last week I read through Chapter 1.

The chapter doesn’t go into code or samples yet. Instead, it sets the stage: it defines the types of analysis (static vs dynamic, basic vs advanced), talks about what kind of questions each method answers, and reinforces the idea that good analysis isn’t about rushing to tools — it’s about approaching problems with structure and patience.

It was a good reminder that malware analysis is more than technical skill. It’s investigative work. It’s puzzle-solving. It’s asking the right questions and peeling away layers slowly.

## What Hit Me Most

Reading this first chapter, what really stayed with me wasn’t a specific tool or term — it was the mindset. The book is careful to teach that tools are just extensions of thought. Knowing when and why to use them is way more important than memorizing hotkeys in IDA or Ghidra.

Malware analysis demands a shift: from broad detection to deep understanding. It asks you to slow down, zoom in, and really pay attention.

It’s exciting. And honestly? Kind of refreshing.

## Setting Up My Lab

I spent part of today setting up a malware lab — just a basic Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox, with snapshots, host-only networking, some starter tools like `IDA`, `ProcMon`, `PEview`, `Resource Hacker` and more stuff.

It’s nothing fancy, but it’s mine. And it’s ready for whatever samples I’ll throw at it in the coming days.

I’ll probably rebuild it a few times during the challenge — break it, reconfigure it, learn something new each time. That’s part of the fun.

## Building This Blog

And yeah — this blog is brand new.

I built it today. I didn’t want this challenge to live in some throwaway notes app or get buried under LinkedIn posts. I wanted a place that’s mine — something I can shape, grow, and look back on.

So here it is. This blog is where I’ll document everything: notes, wins, mistakes, rabbit holes, questions, breakthroughs, frustrations — all of it. If you’re reading this, thanks for stopping by. Seriously. This space isn’t just for me. It’s for you too, especially if you're learning alongside me or thinking about starting something like this yourself.

Even though this blog started with the #100DaysOfMalware challenge, it won’t stop there. I plan to use this space to write about other areas I’m involved in — like DFIR, threat hunting, and AppSec. Sometimes it might be technical deep-dives, other times just reflections on things I’m learning or tools I’m exploring.

After all, it’s all part of the same journey.

## Let’s Be Real

Day 1 wasn’t so flashy. It was more about reading a lot of concepts and structuring this project. But I showed up. I opened the book. I started learning.

That’s the hardest part, isn’t it? Starting.

If you’re on a similar path — whether it’s malware analysis, blue teaming, red teaming, or just breaking into cyber in general — I hope this blog feels like a place where you belong.

I'm not here to prove anything. I’m here to grow. And if you're reading this, I hope you’ll walk some of that path with me. 

See y'all next time. Let’s go.
